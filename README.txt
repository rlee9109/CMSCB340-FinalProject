In order to run our base algorithm, use run.sh with valid class_info.txt and student_prefs.txt files. The argument schedule.txt can be an empty text file, or the name of a textfile you would like produced. The output will include student preference values, best case student values, the fit score, the runtime, and if the schedule is valid or not.

"sh run.sh <class_info.txt> <student_prefs.txt> <schedule.txt>"

In order to run our extension algorithm, use run_ext.sh with enrollment.csv, class_info.txt and student_prefs.txt.  schedule.txt can be an empty text file, or the name of a textfile you would like produced. The output will include student preference values, best case student values, the fit score, and the runtime.

"sh run_ext <enrollment.csv> <class_info.txt> <student_prefs.txt> <schedule.txt>"
